## Description
This web application was made for my final project in my intro to web development course. The Computer Network is a website aimed at teaching users about the different components of a computer and how they all work together to form the computers we use today.

Using this website, I was able to demonstrate my knowledge of HTML and CSS, as well as provide some JavaScript functionality to make it more interactive. I was also able to demonstrate my understanding of responsive design by making the website mobile-friendly and following standard design and accessibility principles to make the viewing experience good for all devices.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
  - Clone the github repository.
  - Navigate to the top level of the directory.
  - Open the `index.html` file in your browser of choice.
