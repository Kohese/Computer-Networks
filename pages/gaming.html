        <h2>Gaming PC vs Regular PC What's the difference?</h2>
        <div class="gaming_container">
          <div class="gaming_text">
            <div class="overview_info">
              <p>A gaming PC is a computer that is designed and optimized for playing video games. They typically have fast processors, high-end video cards, and a large amount of RAM and storage. A regular PC can have all of these things, but they are mainly just general purpose computers that are not optimized for handling such intense tasks.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="overview_info">
              <p>When looking at customization options, gaming PCs offer more options and flexibiliy in comparison yo regular PCs.</p>
              <p>Gaming PCs are generally built with the understanding that it will be upgraded and modified over time. There are always new parts coming out and with video games and applications becoming more and more demanding, it is usually a good idea to look to upgrade every few years. This means that a gaming PC will often have more room for expansion through additional expansion slots, more room for components, and are easier to upgrade.</p>
              <p id="full_p">Gaming PCs tend to be bult with much more powerful and effecient components that can be easily upgraded if needed, components such as CPU, GPU, cooling systems, power supply, motherboard, etc.</p>

        <div class="overview_info pb">
          <p>When looking at a regular computer, they are not built with the same amount of upgradability because they are mostly designed to meet the basic needs of users and are not built for intense programs, so it can be a little limiting in that category.</p>

          <h2>RAM</h2>
          <div class="overview_info">
            <p>When looking at Random Access Memory (RAM) in gaming PCs, there are some key differences from a standard desktop computer. A Gaming computer will typically have more RAM than a regular computer will, since they require more memory to run games at higher settings. It is common for a gaming computer to have 16 GB or more RAM, while a standard desktop would normally have around 8GB or less. It is very beneficial to run a computer with more RAM as it allows for better multitasking, and the ability to run more games and applications simultaneously without the system slowing down.</p>
            <p>A gaming PC will typically use faster RAM than a standard computer, with RAM kits such as DDR4 (Double Data Rate 4) and DDR5 (Double Data Rate 5) which can improve the overall performance of a computer. Having a computer with faster RAM can help reduce the time it takes for a computer to access data, which can provide many speed and responsiveness benefits. In comparison, regular desktop computers do not have the need to use that much RAM for everyday tasks. They also tend to use earlier generations of RAM sticks, typically (DDR2 or DDR3), which can be less expensive but are not able to output the same amount of performance as newer generations.  </p>

          <h2>CPU</h2>
          <div class="overview_info">
            <p>When looking at CPUs in the gaming PC vs regular PC, it is very similar. A gaming PC requires a fast CPU with high clock speeds and lots of cores for intense tasks. A CPU core is essentially the "brain" of a CPU. It will receive instructions, and do the operations necessary to complete the task. A CPU will normally come with multiple cores. A regular computer CPU will have around 2-4 of these cores depending quality of the processor. A gaming PC at minimum can have 4 of these cores, but can have anywhere from 4-12 physical cores.</p>
            <p>I say physical cores because some CPUs also come equipped with the ability of utilizing threads for better multitasking. CPU threads operate similar to CPU cores except they are not on a CPU physically. They are made from software that the CPU can use like a core. Threads can be executed simultaneously on separate cores, which allow different parts of a program to run at the same time. What this means is a CPU with thread capability will treat it as a core, doubling the amount of cores it has, which improves efficiency. </p>

        <h2>Graphics Card</h2>
        <section class="gaming_container">
          <div class="gpu_text">
            <div class="overview_info">
              <p>The graphics card, or video card, is the biggest difference when comparing the 2 systems. The graphics processing unit, or <span class="case_text">GPU</span>, is a specialized processor designed to accelerate graphics rendering. GPUs can process many piecces of data at the same time, making them very useful for gaming. Gaming PCs will have much more powerful GPUs from popular brands like AMD or Nvidia made for gaming.</p>
              <p>The gpu in a gaming PC is the main focus of the system since that is the most direct connection to what you see on the screen when playing video games. The biggest difference that you will see between a gaming PC and a normal computer would be the performance.</p>
              <p>For a normal desktop computer, there are some computer that do not even have a dedicated GPU. This is because the CPUs in the system handle the video processing. These CPUs are called APUs (<span class="case_text">accelerated processing unit</span>). The computers that do have their own dedicated gpus will usually have graphics cards with slower clock speeds and lower memory, which are fine for normal usage but not for any intensive tasks.</p>

        </section>
        <div class="overview_info pb">
          <p>GPUs that come with gaming PCs will have much higher clock speeds and available memory to handle any task you throw at it. There are different tiers of GPUs depending on the budget of the system, with the entry level graphics cards starting at around $200. They are very good options for people just starting out and will give a sufficient amount of performance.</p>
